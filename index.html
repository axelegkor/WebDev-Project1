        <h2>About the artist</h2>
        <p>
          My name is John Doe. I am a web developer and artist. After an intense period at work, I decided to take a break and travel.
          I got to see the wonders of the world, but also how elements from the modern world always come in the way of our appreciation of nature.
          I got the inspiration for this project during my trip through the North African desert. I hope you enjoy it.

        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          For the layout of this website, I have used CSS-grid. CSS-grid allowed me to place the page's elements exactly where I wanted them.
          I created a grid with four columns, all with the same size. This allowed me to have a mainly vertical structure of the site, but still being able to place elements besides each other.
          This was used to place the two paintings next to each other in a symmetric way.
        </p>
        <h2>SVG & Canvas</h2>
        <p>
          The SVG elements are created directly in the HTML file. Most of them are pre-defined shapes, in which case I only had to decide the size and placement.
          The exception is the mountains, which were created as polygons.
          This means that the shapes were created from a set of points.
          The coloring, which changes based on user-click, is defined in the svgPainting.js file.
          This script fills the shapes with a certain color, based on what value of dayTimeIndexSvg.
          When the user clicks on the painting, this value changes, and so does the colors.
          The airplane is created and programmed entirely in HTML, using the “animate” element.
          </p>
        <p>
          The Canvas elements are all drawn in the canvasPainting.js file.
          The same shapes with different colors are created as separate elements.For each iteration of the setInterval function, the canvas is completely cleared, and new elements are drawn.
          Most of the elements are gradient, which gives the painting a more dynamic and realistic look.
          The elements are grouped as sunset/sunrise, day or night elements.
          Which group is drawn is decided by the value of the dayTimeIndexCanvas variable.
          The variable's value changes if a user clicks on the painting.
          In every iteration of the setInterval function, the airplane is redrawn in a slightly different location to animate movement.
          The movement of the plane is timed to give the illusion that the plane is the same one as in the SVG painting.
        </p>
        <h2>jQuery</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, I have used some jQuery functions.
          The "click" function is used to change the value of the dayTimeIndexSvg and dayTimeIndexCanvas variables, upon clicking on the paintings.
          The same function is also used to show and hide the documentation upon clicking on the "Show Documentation"/"Hide documentation" button.
          jQuery is also used to write the logic for showing and hiding the documentation.
          However the largest use of jQuery is in the svgPainting.js file, where it's used to paint the elements.
        </p>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
          This website has been tested in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
        </p>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
          To complete this project, I have used a set of resources.
          I already had a good knowledge of programming, however not so much with the technologies used in the project.
          Therefore, the intro lecture provided some good basic knowledge of the technologies I was using.
          To gain further understanding of how my project could be created, I used online resources.
          I especially used W3schools to learn more about CSS, SVG, Canvas and jQuery.
          I also looked at the documentation for the jQuery API. When I encountered problems, I Googled them.
          This mostly lead me to forums like Stackoverflow, or to an article on a tutorial site, like W3schools.
          Some code is directly inspired by an online resource, in which case there is a comment saying so.
          For the canvasPainting.js file, there is a comment at the very top regarding code from the W3schools canvas tutorial.
